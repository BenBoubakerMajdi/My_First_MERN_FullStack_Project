# My_First_MERN_FullStack_Project
In this project am following the Net Ninga on youtube.
I already have a good knowledge on REACT and I want to upgrade my skills to another level
In this project am going to create a FullStack Mern application using for the first time Node, Express and MongoDB.
Since they are basically pure javascript, I think am not going to struggle alot to learn these new frameworks :).
